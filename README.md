## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd host_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Airtable**:
   - Update the `AIRTABLE_CONFIG` in each file with your Airtable base ID and API key
   - Ensure you have the following tables in your Airtable base:
     - `events`: For storing event information
     - `event_features`: For managing feature configurations
     - `registration_form`: For storing form questions

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Home Dashboard
- Enter your Host ID in the sidebar to view your events
- Click "Etkinlik Olu≈ütur" to create a new event
- View current, upcoming, and past events
- Access feature management for each event

### Navigation Flow
The application uses a controlled navigation flow:
1. **Home Dashboard** (`app.py`) - Main entry point
2. **Event Creation** (`pages/event_creation.py`) - Create new events
3. **Feature Management** (`pages/feature_management.py`) - Configure event features
4. **Form Builder** (`pages/form_builder.py`) - Create registration forms

Users cannot directly access pages from the sidebar - they must follow the proper navigation flow.

### 2. Event Creation
- Fill out the comprehensive event form
- Set event details, location, dates, and capacity
- Configure visibility settings
- Submit to create the event and get redirected to feature management

### 3. Feature Management
- Select features to enable for your event
- Configure registration forms
- Manage feature settings
- Navigate to form builder for detailed configuration

### 4. Form Builder
- Add questions to your registration form
- Choose from various question types
- Set required field indicators
- Preview the form before saving
- Save to Airtable
